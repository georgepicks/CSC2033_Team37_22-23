Code Standards Document:

The python code written in this program conforms to PEP-8 conventions, with the exception of increasing characters per
line from 79 to 129 to conform to the default from the PyCharm IDE. These standards should be maintained while writing
code and verified through the flake8 linter.

Blank lines:
    To maintain readability while minimizing unneeded lines, enter two blank lines after the end of a function or
    class e.g.

        def index():
            return render_template('main/index.html')


        login_manager = LoginManager()


Line wrapping:
    If an expression does not fit within pycharm's default 129 characters, break the wrap directly under bracket e.g.

        postcode = StringField('Postcode', validators=[DataRequired(), validate_postcode],
                               render_kw={"size": 50, "maxlength": 70})


Whitespace:
    Whitespace should follow every comma, and should both follow and precede every operator. Whitespace shouldn't
    follow or precede parentheses e.g.

        def calculate(a, b):
            c = a + b

Naming:
    Variable names should be written in lowercase, using underscores in place of whitespace. Class names should be in
    CamelCase with no spaces, but the beginning of every word is capitalised. Python pages should also be lowercase.


Comments:
    Comments should be used to explain code that may be hard for a reader to interpret. They should follow the format of
    hash, whitespace, lowercase letter, and should be placed on the same indentation as what they're commenting e.g.

        # calculates the sum of a and b
        def calculate(a, b):


Header comments:
    Docstrings should be placed at the top of each python file, and explain what the file and each
    function in the file does. e.g.

        """
        This page defines the forms which are called in the various views pages

        ConsumerRegister():
            ...

        ...
        """
